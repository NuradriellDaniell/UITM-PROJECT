    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        This project, titled “Explore Sumiran Eco Park” focuses on developing an interactive
multimedia presentation that highlights the beauty and uniqueness of Sumiran Eco Park one of
Sarawak’s most relaxing and eco-friendly destinations. The main goal of this project is to use
digital technology to introduce the park in a creative and engaging way that attracts tourist and
raises awareness about sustainable tourism in Malaysia.
In this modern digital era, multimedia has become one of the most powerful tools for
communication. By combining text, images, videos, sound, animation, and interactivity this
project aims to bring the natural environment of Sumiran Eco Park to life in a virtual format.
Users will be able to explore different areas of the park through photo slideshows, video clips
and interactive quizzes that make learning more enjoyable.
This project is not only designed to promote tourism but also to educate the audience
about environmental protection and eco-friendly lifestyles. The presentation will emphasize the
park’s peaceful atmosphere, recreational activities and community-based programs that support
sustainability. It will serve as a digital guide that inspires people to connect with nature, plan
outdoor activities and appreciate the importance of preserving the environment for future
generations.
By integrating creativity with technology, this multimedia project hopes to leave an
impression on its users and encourage them to personally experience the wonders of Sumiran
Eco Park in Batu Kawa.

<!-- 4. PROJECT BACKGROUND -->
<section id="projectbg">
    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>This interactive multimedia project titled “Explore Sumiran Eco Park” is designed to promote
one of Sarawak’s most popular eco-tourism attractions, Sumiran Eco Park located in Batu
Kawa. The project combines several multimedia elements such as video, audio, text, 
animation and graphics to create an engaging and educational experience for users. Each 
element plays a key role in conveying information, enhancing user interaction and promoting
environmental awareness.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Video: Video content is used to introduce the beauty and activities available at 
Sumiran Eco Park. Short video clips will showcase the park’s peaceful environment, 
kayaking sessions, camping areas and team building events. These visuals help tell the 
story of how the park promotes both recreation and sustainability. The videos aim to 
attract viewers by giving them realistic experience of being at the park.</li>
        <li>Audio: Sound is used to create an immersive experience throughout the presentation.
Soft background music, combined with natural sounds such as birds chirping and 
water flowing helps set a relaxing and peaceful mood. Voice narration will also be 
included to guide users through the different sections of the project, explaining the 
park’s attractions and eco-friendly values clearly</li>
        <li>Text: Written content supports the visuals by providing clear explanations and detailed
information about Sumiran Eco Park. The text will describe the park’s background

<!-- 5. LITERATURE REVIEW -->
<section id="literature">
    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
    <p>
        In developing this interactive multimedia project, several existing tourism videos and 
multimedia presentations were analysed as references to understand how visual storytelling, 
audio design and interactivity can effectively promote eco-tourism destinations. These 
examples offer valuable guidance in designing the “Explore Sumiran Eco Park: Nature, Fun & 
Adventure” project to ensure it delivers information in an attractive, informative, and interactive 
way.
One of the most relevant references is the “Malaysia Truly Asia” tourism campaign 
video by Tourism Malaysia. This video successfully combines cinematic visuals, background 
music, and cultural storytelling to create emotional appeal and national identity. It shows how 
music and narration can work together to highlight Malaysia’s natural beauty and cultural 
diversity. From this example, the project team learned the importance of using smooth 
transitions, strong visual rhythm, and warm narration to build a positive impression of Sumiran 
Eco Park. 
Another useful reference is the “Sarawak: More to Discover” promotional video, which 
focuses on eco-adventures and community experiences. The video features short yet impactful 
clips of waterfalls, rainforests, and local traditions, all supported by light background music and 
minimal text. This approach inspired the use of short, focused video segments in the Sumiran 
Eco Park project to keep viewers engaged without overwhelming them with information.
Additionally, several YouTube travel vlogs filmed at eco-parks and nature resorts in 
Malaysia, such as Kubah National Park and Borneo Highlands, provided insight into how video 
creators use personal storytelling, drone shots, and ambient sounds to create an authentic visitor 
experience. These vlogs emphasize natural soundscapes and real-life moments, which 
influenced the decision to include natural ambient audio (birds, water flow, wind) in the project 
to enhance realism.By studying these examples, the development team gained a deeper understanding of 
how multimedia elements especially video and audio can work together to convey emotion, 
promote eco-friendly tourism, and engage different audiences. The techniques seen in these 
existing materials will serve as a creative and technical guideline throughout the production of 
the interactive multimedia project, ensuring that “Explore Sumiran Eco Park” reflects both 
professional quality and environmental storytelling.
